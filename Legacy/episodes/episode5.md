## Locations


- The Spires of Broken Ships: A treacherous area filled with jagged rocks and the remains of shipwrecks, making navigation difficult. The area is known for its dangerous currents and unpredictable weather, often shrouded in mist. It's said that many ships have met their end here, and the spirits of lost sailors are rumored to haunt the waters.

- Coral Graveyard: Is the remains of the witches' civilization, now overgrown with coral and seaweed. The buildings are crumbling, and the area is filled with the remnants of their magic. It's a place of both beauty and danger, as the magic that once protected the island still lingers, but so does the corruption.

- The Skull (Impact Crater): The central feature of Skull Island, a massive crater formed by the impact of the Staff of Seven. The crater is surrounded by jagged rocks and is filled with dark, swirling waters. It's said that the heart of the island's magic lies within the crater, but it's also a place of great danger, as the corruption is strongest here.

- The Sea King Monument: A massive statue of a sea king, carved from coral and stone. The monument is said to be a tribute to the witches' connection to the ocean and their ability to communicate with sea creatures. It's a place of reverence and mystery, as the statue is rumored to hold secrets about the island's past and the magic that once thrived there.


## Secrets and Clues

- Skull Island used to be a beautiful island with a thriving civilization of Witches (The Circle of Seafoam), but when part of the Staff of Seven broken and crashed into the island, it caused the mountain to explode, and nit looks like a skull. The explosion destroyed part of the island but also the lingering blood of Miska the Wolf Spider caused the island to become a place of evil and corruption and cause a permanent storm to surround the island.

- The witches were attuned with the Ocean and used all of its resources to create a beautiful civilization, including  coral buildings, and they were able to communicate with sea creatures. 
 
- The witches were very strong powerful and specialized in water and protection magic, they were able to create a barrier to contain the corruption but they had to sacrifice themselves to do so and using some of `Lex` magic to create the barrier and stasis to prevent the corruption from spreading.

- The only survivor of the event was a young apprentice (Ophelia) she recently woke up from her stasis and is trying to figure out what happened to her people and the island. She has been trying to find a way to restore the island and its magic.

- The some demons (Bez'no'rak) who were followers of the Queen of Chaos and Miska were looking for the parts, and had a conflict wit the witches who were trapped in stasis.

- The `Lex` the piece of the Rod of Seven, was a powerful sorceress and a member `The Seven Creators` , those who come in contact with her piece will have her mind and personality slowly meld with theirs, and they will gain her knowledge and power, but they will also lose their own identity and become a danger to those around them.

- The Vaati (Deva) were the creators of the Staff of Seven, they're seven greats minds imbued themselves into the staff, those who wield it can hear their voices and they can help guide them. But the they also start to take over the wielder's mind and body, and they can become a danger to the wielder.
