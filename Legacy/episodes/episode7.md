- One of the first cauldron is inside the Skull, it was being protected by the witches since it contains the magic to create life. The witches are using a protection spell to keep it safe from the corruption, but it's starting to weaken.

- The protection spell uses the life force of those on the island, and at a point all the witches will die to keep the cauldron safe, `Lex` was used to power the spell and make it more powerful.

- Amila, one of the elders is slowly becoming corrupted, she is trying to find a way to reverse the corruption before she loses herself completely.

- The some demons (Bez'no'rak) who were followers of the Queen of Chaos and Miska were looking for the parts, and had a conflict wit the witches who were trapped in stasis, they can be found inside of the Skull and might help the players.

- The `Lex` the piece of the Rod of Seven, was a powerful sorceress and a member `The Seven Creators` , those who come in contact with her piece will have her mind and personality slowly meld with theirs, and they will gain her knowledge and power, but they will also lose their own identity and become a danger to those around them.

- Because of the corruption of Chaos from Miska, it's actually warped the insides of the mountain causing flair ups of chaotic energy, lava, and magic, making it a dangerous place to be. The insides of the Skull are constantly shifting and changing, making it difficult to navigate.

- The magic from the chaos has animated the elemental spirts of the island and they are now hostile to anyone who enters the island.
