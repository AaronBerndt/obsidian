## Locations


- The Spires of Broken Ships: A treacherous area filled with jagged rocks and the remains of shipwrecks, making navigation difficult. The area is known for its dangerous currents and unpredictable weather, often shrouded in mist. It's said that many ships have met their end here, and the spirits of lost sailors are rumored to haunt the waters.

- Coral Graveyard: Is the remains of the witches' civilization, now overgrown with coral and seaweed. The buildings are crumbling, and the area is filled with the remnants of their magic. It's a place of both beauty and danger, as the magic that once protected the island still lingers, but so does the corruption.

- The Skull (Impact Crater): The central feature of Skull Island, a massive crater formed by the impact of the Staff of Seven. The crater is surrounded by jagged rocks and is filled with dark, swirling waters. It's said that the heart of the island's magic lies within the crater, but it's also a place of great danger, as the corruption is strongest here.

- The Sea King Monument: A massive statue of a sea king, carved from coral and stone. The monument is said to be a tribute to the witches' connection to the ocean and their ability to communicate with sea creatures. It's a place of reverence and mystery, as the statue is rumored to hold secrets about the island's past and the magic that once thrived there.


## Secrets and Clues

- One of the first cauldron is inside the Skull, it was being protected by the witches since it contains the magic to create life. The witches are using a protection spell to keep it safe from the corruption, but it's starting to weaken.

- The protection spell uses the life force of those on the island, and at a point all the witches will die to keep the cauldron safe, `Lex` was used to power the spell and make it more powerful.

- Amila, one of the elders is slowly becoming corrupted, she is trying to find a way to reverse the corruption before she loses herself completely.

- The some demons (Bez'no'rak) who were followers of the Queen of Chaos and Miska were looking for the parts, and had a conflict wit the witches who were trapped in stasis, they can be found inside of the Skull and might help the players.

- The `Lex` the piece of the Rod of Seven, was a powerful sorceress and a member `The Seven Creators` , those who come in contact with her piece will have her mind and personality slowly meld with theirs, and they will gain her knowledge and power, but they will also lose their own identity and become a danger to those around them.

- Because of the corruption of Chaos from Miska, it's actually warped the insides of the mountain causing flair ups of chaotic energy, lava, and magic, making it a dangerous place to be. The insides of the Skull are constantly shifting and changing, making it difficult to navigate.
