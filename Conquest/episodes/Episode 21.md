He has a group Gobkeys that are loyal to him and are willing to do anything to achieve this goal, because they dont like the current state of the Gobkey society moving towards Ostermark rule.

- Eggs from the Spider Queen are being stolen by Gobkeys and are being used for experiments for their poison by Syuul to create a powerful drug to subdue other tribes.
