## Secrets and Clues
- Crusaders have orders from the imperialum to reclaim the Desolation and bring it back into the fold of the empire, but it's a losing battle as the Desolation is a harsh and unforgiving place. They have multiple strongholds in the Desolation, but they are constantly under attack by the denizens of the wastes.
- The Iron Guard are a elite group of the crusaders, where the remains of the crusaders who either died who chose this life to extend their lives to fight for the cause. The ritual is done using necromancy. Angel was one of the first to undergo the ritual.
- Esker, once once a thriving town but now it's a ghost town, after the railroad project was abandoned, the town seems more built up than it should be, but it's mostly empty.
- Tombs of long dead necromancers float above the Desolation, they are said to be filled with treasure and powerful artifacts, but they are also filled with traps and undead guardians.
- Tobias the owner of the Nail and Spice was once part of the Ras-Godai, but fled, he slowly going mad from the black lotus. The Ras-Godai are an elite group of assassins, they only allow the best of the best to join their ranks, they eat the black lotus to gain their powers, but it also drives them mad.
