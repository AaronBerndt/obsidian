 Drink of the Moment: "The Phlogiston Fizz"

Tagline:
“A sparkling sip from the Flow — volatile, vibrant, and vaguely illegal in 3 spheres.”

Appearance:
A shimmering, layered cocktail that glows faintly violet with shifting stars suspended within, served in a tall, twisted crystalline glass shaped like a spelljamming helm.

Ingredients:

    1 oz Voidberry Gin (dark berry flavor, interstellar botanicals)

    0.5 oz Chrono Syrup (a silvery, time-touched sweetener)

    0.5 oz Limequartz Juice (lime + mineral sparkle)

    2 oz Glitterwine (a low-gravity sparkling wine, slightly effervescent with edible starlight flecks)

    Splash of Ectoplasmic Tonic (glows under blacklight)

    Garnish: Comet ice (dry ice orb infused with mint vapor) & a twist of astral citrus peel

Instructions:

    Shake the gin, chrono syrup, and limequartz juice with comet ice in a stardust shaker.

    Strain into the twisted helm glass over a fresh comet orb.

    Top with glitterwine and a gentle splash of ectoplasmic tonic.

    Drop in the citrus twist and watch it glow as the drink swirls into a nebula.

Serving Tip:
Delivered by a minor illusion of a floating beholder, who winks at the guest before vanishing in a puff of nebula mist.
