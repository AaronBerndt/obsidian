- [ ] The black sludge blight is spreading faster than the Sages anticipated - it's now affecting the flower fields near the bunker entrance
- [ ] A child was seen sneaking food from the communal stores late at night, heading toward the eastern tunnels
- [ ] The AI computer has been giving increasingly cryptic warnings about "the yellow dawn" - contradicting its usual output patterns
- [ ] Strange scratching sounds echo from the sealed-off sections of the bunker, where the Vizzerdrix was supposedly killed
- [ ] The tracking device to find the Vault has started pulsing more frequently, suggesting the Vault may be closer than thought
- [ ] A patch of crops survived the blight - they were planted in old 90s computer parts and circuitry, suggesting the technology might protect against it
- [ ] Someone has been secretly adding power cells to the AI computer beyond what the Sages donate, keeping it running longer than expected
- [ ] The Hoarder creature has a weak point beneath yellowed, jaundiced-looking hide - possibly connected to the forbidden color
- [ ] Refugees from a nearby settlement report the blight started after they found strange seeds in an old vault - but those weren't the Seeds of legend
- [ ] The exiled "jaundice child" and the Canaries have been spotted near Eden's territory, possibly drawn back by the crisis
- [ ] Old computer logs reveal the bunker's original purpose was seed preservation - Eden may be sitting on top of the Vault they seek
- [ ] The Cult of the Demonlord's symbols have been found carved near the blight-affected areas, suggesting sabotage rather than natural disaster
