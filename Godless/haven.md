the past and is currently facing.



Past Crises:
A child is born with the features of a dead god.
As people struggle to find meaning, a zealous
cult begins to form around them. "jaundice child", exiled them away from the Haven, Canaries.

Someone is taking far more from the
communal stores than they need. The Haven
wonders not only who, but why? What could
they possibly be feeding? A child was feeding abomination rabbit and this "Vizzerdrix" started killing people, the creature was killed but the culture no longer rasies as many rabbits as they used to, because they fear this creature will return.

Current Crises:

The Haven cannot safely expand any further.
Some must be exiled so that the rest can live.

"Hoarding the object of its obsession" or "Has a weak point beneath its hide or armour"

Some are saying it's the return of the "Vizzerdrix", but others say it is a new creature, a "Hoarder" that has come to take the Haven's resources.

The Haven is running out of food, because the children are stealing food and feeding this . 


Blight reduces the entire harvest to black
sludge. The Haven readies itself for a hungry
season ahead. This unrelated to the Vizzerdrix, this refocuses to find the Vault, which is rumored to have seeds that can restore the land.
